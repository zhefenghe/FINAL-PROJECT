This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(stargazer)
library(httr)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyverse)

x1<-read_xlsx("C:/Users/zhefe/Desktop/497/97poll.xlsx")
x2<-read_xlsx("C:/Users/zhefe/Desktop/497/20poll.xlsx")
x3<-read_xlsx("C:/Users/zhefe/Desktop/497/per.xlsx")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
