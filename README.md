# FINAL-PROJECT
Rmd, dataset, and introduction about final project of STAT184
This protject is aim to test if there is a positive relationship between the School attendence rate and the support rate of PAN.

Backgroud information: Mexico was a typical example of hybrid regime that was ruled by Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
for almost 7 decades and was transferred into democracy in 2000 general election when PRI was beaten by the largest opposition party, 
National Action Party (PAN). 
However, before general education in 2000, PAN was suppressed by PRI in elections. For example, 
in 1994’s president election, PRI candidate won 48.7% votes to PAN candidate’s 25.9% votes (Sheridan).
So, what factors contributed PAN’s increasing votes in the end of 1990s?  

As education provides people with reading and comprehension abilities to realize political event happened around, t
o understand purposes of political events, and to participate political activities such as election, presentation, and debates. 

So I made following assumption:
there is a positive relationship between the School attendence rate and the support rate of PAN.

I found the election map for PAN in legislative election of 1997 and 2000 in detail from Election Resources on the Internet:
Federal Elections in Mexico by Manuel Álvarez-Rivera.  
Also, I have before the changing in school attending and pupils failing percentages by districts in Mexico in 1990s 
from The Educational and Social Situation in Mexico: 
The Future of Girls’ Education, which indicates the school attending & dropping rate in 1990s by states in Mexico.

These two build up the data source for this project.
